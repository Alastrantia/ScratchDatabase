# ScratchDatabase
trying to use scratch as a database with unlimited server space for any use

some ideas already:
- Use comments
-     +   very simple
-     +   no need to make multiple projects
-     +   easy to use, good api
-     -   500 characters limit per comment
-     -   privacy concerns, comments might be accessible for everyone even if project is private
- Use (multiple) projects
-     + alot of storage
-     + private since the changes in the api
-     - Smaller limits: 5mb project.json, 10mb single asset
-         + aren't too much of an issue, 10GB project size is still fine
-     - harder to use api
-     - saving projects takes quite long at bigger sizes
-     - need to save data in .svg or .wav and extract it again

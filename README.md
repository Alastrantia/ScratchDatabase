# ScratchDatabase
trying to use scratch as a database with unlimited server space for any use
## **IN DEVELOPMENT!**

idk if this even works, but it would be great if it does!

some ideas already:
- Use comments
  - very simple
  - no need to make multiple projects
  - easy to use, good api
  - 500 characters limit per comment
  - privacy concerns, comments might be accessible for everyone even if project is private
- Use (multiple) projects
  - alot of storage
  - private since the changes in the api
  - Smaller limits: 5mb project.json, 10mb single asset
    - aren't too much of an issue, 10GB project size is still fine
  - harder to use api
  - saving projects takes quite long at bigger sizes
  - need to save data in .svg or .wav and extract it again

> option with multiple projects is more realistic, as the comments are likely to be cracked and have that stupid 500 letter limit
